# Memory Bandwidth Testing

The basic premise of this repo is to house my attempts at measuring memory bandwidth in Rust.

My attempts will become more and more insane as time goes on, my third attempt uses AVX512 and `[tsc](https://software-dl.ti.com/codegen/docs/c7000/optimization_guide/3_profiling/compopt-prof_clock_function.html)` registers on x64.
